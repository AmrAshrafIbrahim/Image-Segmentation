Image Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, 
also known as image regions or image objects, Representing each object in different color.
Image segmentation means that we can group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. 
The grouping problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark
